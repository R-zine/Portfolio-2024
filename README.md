## About

This project is made with Astro with React, Vue, Svelte and HTMX integrations. There is also an Angular page, which, at the time of writing, cannot be integrated with the other frameworks, because it breaks them. Is this a good idea? No, not really, but to me that's the purpose of creating a personal dev portfolio - to push both my own personal limits as well as those of the technology I'm using on a daily basis.
